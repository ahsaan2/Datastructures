     * using classes we can create our own data type
     * A class(is a logical construct) is an template of an object and an object is an instance(Physical stuff) of a class
     * Object is a physical reality --> this actually occupies the space in memory
     * Object has 3 properties --> State of the object , identity of the object and behaviour of the object
     * Objects are stored in the heap memory and the reference variables are stored in the stack memory.
     * Dot-Operator --> linkes object reference variable with the instance variabl
     * Dot_operator is used to access any instance varaible

     * In order to create objets we have to use new keyword
     * new--> Allocates the memory at runtime and return a reference to it
     * Hence all class objects in java must be allocated dynamically(At the runtime)
     * ** In java there is no way we can get the address or reference of variable or object because there is no concept of
     *  the pointers in java(It will be a security breach)
     * (Q) why don't we use new keyword with primitives-->>In java primitive data types are not treated as objects
     * and they are stored in stack
