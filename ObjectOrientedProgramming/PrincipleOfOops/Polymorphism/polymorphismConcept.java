     * means many ways to represent-->> Ability of the message to be displayed in
     * more than one forms.
     * Real-life Example-->> A person at the same time can have different
     * characteristics, like a man can be a father,
     * a husband, or an employee.
     * TYPES OF POLYMORPHISM IN JAVA
     * (1.) COMPILE TIME POLYMORPHISM-->> this is also known as static polymorphism,
     * it is achieved by "method overloading" or operator overloading (not supported
     * in java).
     * -->> Method Overloading-->> When there are "multiple functions with the same
     * name but different parameters" then these functions are said to be
     * overloaded.
     * Functions can be overloaded by changes in the number of arguments.
     * -->> Example multiple constructors
     * A a = new A();
     * A a2 = new A(12,21); //
     * Java determines which method or constructor is to be called at the compile
     * time.
     * 
     * (2.)RUN-TIME POLYMORPHISM / DYNAMIC POLYMORPHISM-->> acheived by method
     * Overriding.
     * Method-Overrriding -->> When a child class has a method same name as that of
     * the super-class, exact everything is same but the body is different
