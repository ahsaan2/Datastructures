     * Encaptulation means -->> wrapping up the implementation of the data memebers
     * and methods.
     * It is integrating data (variables) and code(methods) into a single unit.
     * It hides the code and all the data into a single entity or a unit so that can
     * be protected from the outside unit.
     * Encaptulation is solving an implementaion issue.
     * Encaptulation is a process of containg the information
     * >> Data hiding<<
     * is for data security along with hiding the complexity , data should always be
     * in private
     * 
     * -->> Abstraction --<<
     * means un-necessary details are hidden and "shows only  valuable information".
     * -->>
     * Ex--> Starting a car.
     * Abstract data-types--> we are able to access and modify, but how they are
     * working internally we dont care about that.
     * Abstraction is solving a design level issue.
     * Abstraction is a process of gaing information.
     * // Here we use interfaces.
