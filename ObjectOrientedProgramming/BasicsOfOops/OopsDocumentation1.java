// Class--> A named group of properties and functions. Classes are not a
// real-world entity thus they do not occupy memory spaces
/**
 * using classes we can create our own data type.(Example: Class Node {})
 * A class(is a logical construct) is an template of an object and an object is
 * an instance(Physical stuff) of a class.
 * Object is a physical reality -->> this actually occupies the space in memory.
 * Object has 3 properties -->> State of the object , Identity of the object and
 * Behaviour of the object.
 * Objects are stored in the Heap memory and the reference variables are stored
 * in the Stack memory.
 * Dot-Operator -->> linkes object reference variable with the instance variable
 * Dot-Operator is used to access any instance varaible.

/**
 * In order to create objets we have to use new keyword() 
 * new-->> Allocates the memory at runTime and return a reference to it.
 * Hence all class objects in java must be allocated dynamically(At the runtime)
 * ** In java there is no way we can get the address or reference of variable of
 * object because there is no concept of
 * the pointers in java(It will be a security breach).
 * (Q) why don't we use new keyword with primitives-->>In java primitive data
 * types are not treated as objects and they are stored in the stack.
