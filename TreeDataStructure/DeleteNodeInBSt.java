/**
 * Cases to delete a node in bst
 * "1". If we have to delete a leaf node(check if the left and right is null, if
 * the left is null then return the right and if right is null then return the
 * left),
 * find the parent of the node first
 * and then make the left/right of the parent as null.
 * 
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 
 * "2". If the item we have to delete is not the leaf node and has children
 * nodes, suppose on the left side, then we have to update the left in such a
 * way that the condition of the bst remains
 * satisfied.
 * 
 *  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 
 * "3".We have to delete a node that is not a leaf node and has children on both
 * the sides, left and right children.
 * Once we reach to the node that is to be deleted we will go in the right
 * sub-tree of that node,
 * and find out the smallest number(will be present in the left most side of
 * that sub-tree(InOrder successor)).
 * -->> Find the smallest number in that subTree-->> we will call that subtree
 * and the smallest item will be found on the left most side of that tree.
 * -->> Now once we find the smallest node, we will replace it with the item
 * that is removed from the tree.
 * -->> The smallestNode we found might have a right node also, we will make that
 * node as the right of the parent node.
