     * Breadth first search or level first search -->> it is used to search a graph

     * criteria.
     * It starts from the "root node and visits all nodes at the current depth
     * level"
     * before moving on to the nodes at the next depth level.
     * Here we go level by level.
     * --------------when to use the BFS---------
     * 1. when ever our answer lies near the root of the tree.
     * 2. when we are asked to search by levels.

     * -------ALGORITHM----
     * // HERE WE STORE THE EVERY CHILD OF THE NODE IN THE QUEUE AND WE ACCESS IT,
     * WE ACCESS THE ITEMS IN THE FIRST IN FIRST OUT.
     * 1. create a queue and fill it with the items
     * 2. get the root node at the beginning of the queue.
     * 3. Once we have removed the head of the queue, or the root node, we then add
     * all the child items of the root node in the queue, now since we got all the
     * child nodes of the root node
     * we then "remove the first child of the root node" and "add its children" in
     * the
     * queue if present in the queue. We keep this process till the queue gets
     * "empty"
     * and by this way we access all the items in a level manner.
